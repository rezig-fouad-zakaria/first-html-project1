    <h1>Virtualization</h1>
    <p>In computing, <b>virtualization</b> refers to the act of of creating a virtual <i>(rather than actual)</i> version of something.</p>
    <p>This includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) level</b><br/>
        <p>Every machine has an instruction set. THis inctruction sete is an interface between software and hardware. Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Virtualization at Operating System (O.S.) level</b><br/>
        <p>In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratchi.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>In cloud sometimes, we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, if we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer (HAL) level this can take too much time.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>So, to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating System level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware/p>
        </li>
        <ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
